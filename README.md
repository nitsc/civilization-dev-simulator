# civilization-dev-simulator

## overview

This Civilization Development Simulator simulates the development of a civilization through random events, population growth, resource management, and technological advances. At the heart of the program is a `Civilization` class, which represents multiple attributes of a civilization, such as population, resources, and technology. As each year progresses, the civilization experiences growth and decline, and even faces collapse.

## necessary condition

## notes

A small randomly written framework that can really only be played with for a bit. People could add more events, different civilization types or more fine-grained resource and technology management, or even use machine learning.
